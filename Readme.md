# Kavita Project 
- Research experience under Dra. Patricia Ordóñez supervision.
- Create a prototype through the integration of modified versions of open-source assistive technologies for Kavita, a student with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) to make it easier for her to program by having a voice interface.

## Proof of Concept
The goal behind this project is to create a coding tool for programers with disabilities or who are not able to program (in the typical way). With this program they will be able to record talk in a natural way and the program will translate it into code. 


## Requeriments
- Python 3.5+ 
- VoiceRecognition
- PyAudio

To install theses:

- Windows

```
pip install VoiceRecognition
pip install pyaudio
```
- if pip fails to install pyaudio on windows use pipwin
```
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```
- Linux and MacOS
```
pip3 install VoiceRecognition
pip3 install pyaudio
```
